# FixMate Voice-Over Demonstration Script (3 Minutes)

## Introduction (15 seconds)
"Welcome to FixMate - an intelligent error log prioritization system that helps development teams efficiently manage and resolve application errors using AI-powered analysis."

## Dashboard Overview (30 seconds)
"Let's start with the FixMate dashboard. Here you can see our key metrics:
- Total error logs in the system
- Resolved vs Pending status counts
- Recent activity trends

The dashboard provides a quick overview of your application's health and error resolution progress. Notice the clean, modern interface with intuitive navigation."

## Adding New Error Logs (45 seconds)
"Now let's add a new error log to demonstrate the system. I'll click 'Add New Log' and enter sample error data:
- Priority level: High
- Source: API Gateway
- Error message: Database connection timeout
- Stack trace details

The system automatically timestamps the entry and assigns it a pending status. Our AI analysis will provide potential fix suggestions based on the error pattern."

## Viewing Error Logs List (60 seconds)
"Moving to the logs page, you can see all error entries in a comprehensive table with:
- Priority indicators with color coding
- Timestamps for tracking
- Source applications
- Error messages with truncation for readability
- AI-generated potential fix suggestions with lightbulb icons
- Severity levels
- Resolution status (Pending/Resolved)

The table supports sorting by priority, timestamp, severity, and status. You can also filter logs using the search functionality."

## New More Options Dropdown (45 seconds)
"Here's our latest feature - the More Options dropdown in the Actions column. Each log row now has three action buttons:
- View Details (eye icon)
- View Stack Trace (bug icon) 
- More Options (three dots icon)

When I click the More Options dropdown, you'll see four powerful actions:
1. **Change Priority** - Adjust the urgency level of errors
2. **Create ADO Story** - Generate Azure DevOps work items directly
3. **Ignore This Type** - Filter out recurring non-critical errors
4. **Mark as Resolved** - Update the resolution status

Let me demonstrate the Mark as Resolved functionality..."

## Mark as Resolved Workflow (30 seconds)
"When I click 'Mark as Resolved', a confirmation dialog appears asking for verification. After confirming, the system:
- Updates the status from Pending to Resolved
- Records the resolution timestamp
- Changes the status indicator color
- Provides user feedback via notifications

The resolved log now shows a green 'Resolved' status with a checkmark icon."

## AI Integration & Performance (15 seconds)
"FixMate integrates with Microsoft Azure AI to provide intelligent error analysis and fix suggestions. The system is optimized for performance with lazy loading, efficient table rendering, and responsive design that works across all devices."

## Conclusion (10 seconds)
